*Notes*
* SSHd and HTTPd
    - Daemon processes - background services that run on Unix/Linux systems to handle specific types of network communication. 
    - SSH Daemon : handles incoming SSH connections, allows remote users to lof into the system securely, execute command and transfer files (via SFTP or SCP)
    - `systemctl status  sshd`

    - httpd: handles Http/Https web traffic, serves web pages and responds to web browser or API requests. Common implementations: Apache (httpd), Nginx(nginx)


* Configure DDOS Vectors
    - Specific detection and mitigation settings for various DDoS attack types 
    - Protection at multiple layers:
        - Device-level DDoS (protects the system itself)
        - Virtual server-level DDoS (protects specific apps/services)
        - Self IP or route domain-level (used in large environments)
    - Create a DoS Protection Profile 
    - Enables vectors based on risk:
        - SYN flood
        - UDP flood
        - ICMP flood
        - DNS query flood
        - HTTP GET/POST flood
    - Set detection thresholds (pps or bps)
    - Set mitigation thresholds and Rate limits 
    - Optionally enable auto-blacklisting, IP intelligence, or device learning 
    - Add or edit a protected object 
        - Type: Virtual Server 
        - Assign the DoS profile 
        - Define direction (client-side or server-side)
        - Apply thresholds 
    - Configure vectors to protect management services (HTTPd, SSHd)

    *Important Best Practices*
    - Set thresholds based on baseline traffic measurements 
    - Use IP intelligence to block known bad sources 
    - Always protect Self IPs and management interfaces 
    - Enable logging for auditing and tuning

**F5CAB1.02 Identify management connectivity configurations**
* [Identify the configured management-IP address](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K15040)
    - [IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack support for the management interface](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K12430)
    - [Overview od the management interface (port)](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K7312)

* [Interpret port lockdown settings to Self-IP](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000141066)
     
    *Notes*

    The port lockdown setting is to allow connections to “terminate” on the individual Self-IPs. This is only useful for a few scenarios like – connecting to the self IPs as mgmt interfaces (a big no-no), iQuery® traffic, HA / Sync traffic, IPSEC termination endpoints. If you don’t have any of those going on, then you should always set your port lockdown settings to “allow-none”.

* [Show remote connectivity to the BIG-IP Management interface]
    
    *Notes*
    
    The BIG-IP management interface may lose connectivity when using fixed media settings.
    tmsh list /net interface mgmt media-active 

    output showing that the interface is set to half duplex:

    net interface mgmt { 
        media-active 100TX-HD
    }

    **workaround**

    - Connect the serial console to the CONSOLE port of the BIG-IP system 
    - Display the SCCP or AOM command menu, type the following key sequence
        - Esc ( 
    - Press 1 to select 'Connect to the Host subsystem console'
    - Log in to the command line of the BIG-IP system 
    - Set the management interface to use auto-negotiation, type the following command:
        - tmsh modify /net interface mgmt media auto 
        - tmsh save /sys config 
        - reboot 
    - when the BIG-IP system is back to an active state, change the media setting from auto to the desired fixed setting 
        - tmsh modify /net interface mgmt media <Desired-Fixed-Media-Setting>
        eg : tmsh modify /net interface mgmt media 100TX-FD
    - tmsh save /sys config
